# Fake Job Posting Prediction

This project aims to detect fraudulent job postings using machine learning models. The goal is to analyze job posting data and develop a predictive model that can distinguish between real and fake job advertisements.

## Project Structure

- **`FakeJobPrediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling steps for predicting fake job postings.
- **`fake_job_postings.csv`**: The dataset containing various job postings with features such as job title, location, description, requirements, and a label indicating whether the posting is fraudulent.

## Key Analysis and Modeling Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data distribution and identifying key patterns that differentiate real and fake job postings.
3. **Model Training**: Building machine learning models to predict the fraudulent label, with evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Discuss model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
